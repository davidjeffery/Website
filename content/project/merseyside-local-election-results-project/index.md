This is an attempt to map out local election results from across Merseyside, from 1945 to 2019. You can find [the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M62Kn7Za_70jvmC5DI9hzXMyEfD5S5vwZrniPt7s0Sg/edit#gid=0).

If you notice any errors or have any information I'm missing, please get in touch via [Twitter](https://www.Twitter.com/DrDavidJeffery) or [email](mailto:djeffery@liverpool.ac.uk).
