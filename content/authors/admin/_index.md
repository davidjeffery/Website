Hi! I'm David, a lecturer in politics at the University of Liverpool. 

My research interests are broad, but typically centre around the concept of identity and its influence on voting behaviour. This takes two main forms:

1. Exploring which local (sub-national) identities are politically salient, and how this salience plays out with regard to voting behaviour.

2. Exploring the impact of identities on the voting behaviour of elected parliamentarians, as well as the broader reasons why they vote the way they do.

3. Anything else which piques my interest.

I am also involved in building a database of local election results from across Merseyside, imaginatively called the [Merseyside Local Election Results Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M62Kn7Za_70jvmC5DI9hzXMyEfD5S5vwZrniPt7s0Sg/edit#gid=0).

In my spare time I'm usually found triathlon training (my 2021 goal is to complete the Challenge Peguera Mallorca half-Ironman), watching reruns of Friends on Netflix, or learning Spanish on Duolingo.
