abstract: This is a presentation I gave at the Danube Institute's 2022 conference on The Post-Liberal Turn and the Future of British Conservatism. In this talk I explore the extent to which post-liberalism can be found within the modern British Conservative Party both in terms of within the parliamentary party and among the party’s voters. To do this, I analyse the speeches given in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election before using data from the British Election Study to construct a scale to measure post-liberalism among voters.
