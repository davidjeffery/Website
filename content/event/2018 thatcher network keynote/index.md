abstract: In this talk I explore the causes of Conservative Party decline in Liverpool, and explain why Thatcher was not the cause of this decline. Instead, I show why we should break up the Conservative's experience in Liverpool into three distinct phases (success, decline, irrelevance) and that Thatcher post-dated the period of decline.
