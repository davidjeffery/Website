summary: This is a presentation I gave at the 2021 Political Studies Association Annual Conference in March 2021. In this talk, I look at a) the geographic distribution of the Scouse identity across Merseyside - Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton, St. Helens and the Wirral, b) the relationship between Scouseness and party politics, c) how Scouseness compared to Britishness, Englishness, Scottishness and Welshness when it comes to ideological values, including left-right position, authoritarian-libertarianism, populism and equality, d) and how scouse identity impacts support for the Liverpool City Region. ðŸš¨ Warning: I tried to fit 30 mins of content into 20 mins - if you want to have a more in-depth conversation, or want to have a chat about potential research collaboration, please get in touch! I'm always happy to geek out.
